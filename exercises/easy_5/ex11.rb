# You are given a method named spin_me that takes a string as an argument and returns a string that contains the same words, but with each word's characters reversed. Given the method's implementation, will the returned string be the same object as the one passed in as an argument or a different object?

def spin_me(str)
  str.split.each do |word|
    word.reverse!
  end.join(" ")
end

spin_me("hello world") # "olleh dlrow"

name = "Kevin"

p "Before mutation: #{name.object_id}"
p "After mutation: #{spin_me(name).object_id}"

# The returned string is the same object.
