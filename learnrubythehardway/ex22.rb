=begin

puts - Puts. Prints objects and variables to the console as a string.
# - Hash. Comments code so Ruby doesn't read them.
#{} - String interpolation. Calls variables and the sum of numbers inside strings.
+ - Plus sign. Adds numbers, strings and variables.
/ - Division sign. Divides numbers and variables.
- - Minus sign. Subtracts numbers and variables.
* - Multiplication sign. Multiplies numbers and variables.
% - Modulo sign. Finds the remainder of two numbers.
< - Less than. Compares two values and outputs true if one is less than the other.
> - Greater than. Compares two values and outputs true if one is greater than the other.
>= - Greater than or equal to. Compares two values and outputs true if one is greater than or equal to the other.
<= Less than or equal to. Compares two values and outputs true if one is less than or equal to the other.
variable - Variable. They are labels for objects, so you can assign an object to a variable and name it whatever you want.
= - Equal. Assigns objects and numbers to variables.
"" - Double-quotes. Anything surrounded by them are strings, EXCEPT for string interpolations and double-quote characters.
'' - Single-quotes. Anything surrounded by them are strings.
false - False. A false boolean operator gets printed to the console if two values are compared and the result isn't true.
#{''} - Unknown name. Useful for calling double-quotes within double-quotes.
%{} - Unknown name. Anything inside the braces turn into a string.
\n - New line. Enters a new line in a string.
%q - Unknown name. Surrounds the braces inside with single-quotes.
\t - Tab. Creates indents.
\\ - Double back slash. A single slash is an escape character, meaning it will leave an output of the extra back slash.
""" - Triple double-quotes. Used for surrounding code in multiple lines.
gets - Gets. Gets input from the user, then creates a new line right after.
.chomp - Chomp. Deletes the new line "gets" creates.
.to_i - To integer. Converts a number in a string to an integer.
.to_f - To float. Converts a number in a string to a float.
print - Print. Like puts, it prints strings, objects, and variables to the console, except it does so in one line.
ARGV - Argument variable. It takes the input entered in the command line, then puts the input an array.
$stdin - Global variable. Like a variable, you can add string inside them and call them anywhere in the program. To add strings inside them, you'd have to get user input first.
, - Comma. Useful for assigning an object to multiple variables and printing strings on a new line.
.first - First. Returns the first element or object of a collection.
open() - Open. Opens an external file.
.read - Read. Reads an external file, then prints it in the command line.
.close - Close. Closes the external file to conserve memory and space.
open(file, 'w') - Open. Opens an external file in writable mode.
.truncate() - Truncate. Deletes a decimal value after a given length, starting after the decimal point.
.write - Write. Writes text inside external file.
; - Semi-colon. Strings lines of code together into one line.
def - Define. Opens a definition block with a variable, assigns arguments to it, then you can write whatever commands you want the variable to do.
end - End. Ends the definition block, closing it.
.length - Length. Measures the length of a string, then prints the lenght in numeric form.
.to_s - To string. Converts variables, numbers, etc to a string.
.seek() - Seek. It goes to any position in a file you want, as long as you call it with numbers.
+= - Plus and equal. Adds two variables, then assigns the sum to the first variable.
return - Return. It will return the value you put, then exits out of the function.
