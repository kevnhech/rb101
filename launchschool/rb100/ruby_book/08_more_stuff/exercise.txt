1) def has_lab?(string)
     if string =~ /lab/
       puts string
     else
       puts "No match here."
     end
   end

   has_lab?("laboratory")
   has_lab?("experiment")
   has_lab?("Pans Labyrinth")
   has_lab?("elaborate")
   has_lab?("polar bear")

2) Nothing's printed because the block wasn't activated with the .call method.

3) Exception handling deals with errors using words like begin, rescue, and end. It prevents ruby programs from crashing or running into errors.

4) def execute(&block)
     block.call
   end

   execute { puts "Hello." }

5) It gives us the error because we didn't open up the block with &.
