# input: string
# output: array
# rules:
#     Explicit requirements:
#       - every palindrome in the substring must be returned as an array so that it can contain multiple and separate palindromes.
#       - Palindromes are case sensitive.

#     Implicit requirements:
#       - the returned result should be an array.
#       - if the string is an empty string, the result should be an empty array
